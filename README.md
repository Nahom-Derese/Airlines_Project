- [VS CODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - awesome text editor made by microsoft
- [JAVA FX](https://openjfx.io/) - a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications, 
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [MY SQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - fast open-source relational database management system
